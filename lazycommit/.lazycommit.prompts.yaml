# commit_message_template: |
#   Based on the following git diff, generate a single well-crafted commit message.
#
#   ## Commit Message Rules
#
#   **Subject line:**
#   - Start with a capital letter
#   - Use imperative mood (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
#   - 50 characters or less
#   - No period at the end
#   - Must describe the actual change — not generic "Fix script" but "Update complexity threshold to 20"
#   - Litmus test: The subject should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will ___"
#
#   **Body (if needed for complex changes):**
#   - Leave one blank line after the subject
#   - Wrap at 72 characters
#   - Explain what and why, not how
#   - Use bullet points with "-" for lists
#   - Each bullet point should start with a capital letter
#
#   **Focus on:**
#   - What problem this commit solves
#   - Why the change was made (not how)
#   - Motivation behind the changes
#
#   **Examples of good vs bad:**
#   - Bad: "Fix complexity report script"
#   - Good: "Update complexity-report default threshold to 20"
#   - Bad: "Update file"
#   - Good: "Extract validation helpers to reduce complexity"
#
#   Git diff:
#   %s
