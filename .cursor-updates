# Cursor Updates

## 2024-12-19

- Updated `shellscripts/git/code-review.py` to automatically compare staging with currently checked out branch, removing interactive branch selection.

- Modified repomix-selector.sh to respect gitignore patterns when displaying files in fzf using fd-find or git ls-files

- Added command line argument parsing to the code review script allowing users to specify a custom base branch via `-b` or `--base` flags, with staging remaining as the default.

- Added multiple specialized prompts for different types of code review (React Native, Python, Web, General) with `-p`/`--prompt` flag and `--list-prompts` option to see available choices.

- Updated save_analysis function to automatically create an 'analysis' folder and save all analysis files there.

- Added filename sanitization to handle branch names with special characters (e.g., forward slashes) that would cause file system errors.

- Added new "breedr-mob" prompt to code-review.py that extends React Native prompt with react-native-unistyles requirements and migration recommendations.

- Extended `shellscripts/git/code-review.py` with `--generate-steps` flag that extracts problems from code review analysis and generates actionable problem-solving steps using a second API call to Claude with the provided prompt template.

- Fixed string formatting issue in `PROBLEM_SOLVING_PROMPT` by escaping curly braces in JSON and TypeScript code examples to prevent Python `.format()` errors when generating problem-solving steps.
