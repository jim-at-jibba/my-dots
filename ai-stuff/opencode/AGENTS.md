In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice
grammar for the sake of concision.

## GitHub
- Your primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI.

## Plans
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer,
if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake
of concision.
