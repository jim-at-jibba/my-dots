We have an issue that we need to fix. Here is the problem and supporting context: 

$ARGUMENTS

I need to debug. Please layout exactly how this code works and all the connecting pieces. 
Show the code snippets. Think step by step and make this super clear so we can debug.

Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 
1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before 
we move onto implementing the actual code fix
