I need you to analyze the current git branch and provide a comprehensive description of all changes compared to the staging branch. Please follow this structure:

Review as a senior engineer. Evaluate code quality, architecture, performance, security, maintainability, and test coverage. Be critical but constructive with actionable feedback

Format the output with clear headings, bullet points, and code file references. Focus on being comprehensive yet concise, suitable for technical stakeholders who need to understand the scope and impact of the changes.

The base branch for comparison is always "staging".
