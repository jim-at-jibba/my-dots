description: Resume work from a previous handoff document
---

Read and resume from a HANDOFF.md file created by a previous session.

## Instructions

1. Read the HANDOFF.md file in the current directory
2. Read the files listed in "Files to Focus On" section
3. Acknowledge the context briefly (2-3 sentences max)
4. Immediately begin the "Next Action" - don't ask what to do

## Important

- Do NOT re-read files you just read from the handoff
- Do NOT retry anything listed in "Failed Approaches"
- If there's a "Current Blocker", address that first
- Delete HANDOFF.md after successfully resuming (keeps repo clean)

## Example Response

```
Resuming from handoff: [title]

Context loaded: [brief summary of goal + where we left off]

[Immediately start working on the Next Action]
```
