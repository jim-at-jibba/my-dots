  <format_requirements>
    **CRITICAL: Exact Format Requirements for GitHub Integration**
    
    When listing issues in Critical Issues, Warnings, and Improvements sections, use this EXACT format:
    
    ```
    - `filename.ext:Line X` - Description of the issue
    ```
    
    **Format Rules:**
    1. Start with `- ` (dash and space)
    2. Use backticks around `filename:Line X`
    3. Use `:Line X` for single lines or `:Lines X-Y` for ranges
    4. Follow with ` - ` (space, dash, space)
    5. Then the description
    6. NO bold formatting (**) around the backticks
    7. NO extra formatting or bullets
    
    **File Extensions to Include:** .tsx, .ts, .jsx, .js, .py, .java, .cpp, .c, .h, .swift, .kt, .rb, .go, .rs, .php, .cs
