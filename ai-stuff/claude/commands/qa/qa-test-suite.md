# QA Test Suite

I need you to analyze the changes on the current git branch compared to the staging branch and generate a comprehensive QA test report. Please follow these steps:

1. First, identify what files have been modified by comparing the current branch to staging
2. Examine the specific code changes in each modified file to understand what functionality has been altered
3. Review the commit messages to understand the intent behind the changes
4. Based on your analysis, create a detailed QA test plan that includes:

   - Overview of what was changed and why
   - Primary focus areas for testing (prioritized by risk/impact)
   - Device-specific testing requirements (mobile vs tablet, portrait vs landscape)
   - Detailed test cases with step-by-step instructions
   - Edge cases and error scenarios to test
   - Cross-device testing matrix if applicable
   - Success criteria and red flags to watch for
   - Test completion checklist

Please structure the report with clear sections, use checkboxes for test items, and prioritize test cases by importance (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). Focus on practical, actionable test scenarios that a QA engineer can follow without deep technical knowledge of the codebase.

The base branch for comparison is always "staging".
