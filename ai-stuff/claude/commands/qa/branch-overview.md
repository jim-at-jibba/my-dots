# Branch Overview

I need you to analyze the current git branch and provide a comprehensive description of all changes compared to the staging branch. Please follow this structure:

1. **Branch Overview**: Start with the branch name and a high-level summary of what this branch accomplishes

2. **Major Features Analysis**: 
   - Examine commit messages and file changes to identify the main features implemented
   - Group related changes into logical feature categories
   - For each major feature, list the key files added/modified and explain what was implemented

3. **Technical Improvements**: 
   - Identify code quality improvements, refactoring, performance enhancements
   - Note any architectural changes or developer experience improvements

4. **User-Facing Changes**:
   - Describe how these changes affect the end user experience
   - Explain new functionality or improved workflows

5. **Testing and Quality**:
   - Note test coverage additions, code standards compliance
   - Include any documentation or quality assurance improvements

6. **Impact Summary**:
   - Provide file change statistics (files changed, lines added/removed)
   - Summarize the overall impact and significance of the branch

Please use the following commands to gather information:
- Compare current branch to staging for file lists and statistics
- Review commit history for context and intent
- Analyze key file changes to understand functionality

Format the output with clear headings, bullet points, and code file references. Focus on being comprehensive yet concise, suitable for technical stakeholders who need to understand the scope and impact of the changes.

The base branch for comparison is always "staging".
