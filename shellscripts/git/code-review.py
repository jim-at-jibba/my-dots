# Supporting Information

# Steps to Complete

<example>
## Problem

We want to set up a new MCP server, written in TypeScript. We are starting from an empty directory.

We are writing this in Cursor, so recording the important files in a `.cursor/rules/important-files.mdc` file is important.

We need to set up the basic file system for the project, install necessary dependencies, and set up the project structure.

## Supporting Information

### Tools

#### `pnpm`

Use `pnpm` as the package manager.

### File Structure

Recommended file structure:

#### `.cursor/rules/important-files.mdc`

A file that lists the important files for the project, which should be included in every chat.

Use the `mdc` format, which is a markdown format with these frontmatter fields:

```md
---
globs: **/**
alwaysApply: true
---

...content goes here...
```

Make sure to add a directive at the end of the file that if new files are added, they should be added to the `important-files.mdc` file.

#### `package.json`

The package.json file for the project.

Recommended scripts:

`build`: Builds the project using `tsc`.
`dev`: Runs the project in development mode using `tsx watch src/main.ts`.

Dependencies:

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: The MCP SDK. Latest version is `0.9.0`.
- `zod`: A schema declaration and validation library for TypeScript.

Dev dependencies:

- `tsx`: A faster version of `ts-node` that is optimized for the CLI.
- `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler, latest version: `5.8`
- `@types/node`: The types for Node.js, for 22+

`bin` should be set to `dist/main.js`.

`type` should be set to `module`.

#### `tsconfig.json`

The TypeScript configuration file for the project. Here is the recommended configuration from Matt Pocock's TSConfig cheat sheet.

```jsonc
{{
  "compilerOptions": {{
    /* Base Options: */
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "target": "es2022",
    "allowJs": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,

    /* Strictness */
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,

    /* If transpiling with TypeScript: */
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "sourceMap": true,

    /* AND if you're building for a library: */
    "declaration": true,

    /* If your code doesn't run in the DOM: */
    "lib": ["es2022"]
  }},
  "include": ["src"]
}}
```

#### `src/main.ts`

The entry point for the project.

```ts
import {{
  McpServer,
  ResourceTemplate,
}} from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import {{ StdioServerTransport }} from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import {{ z }} from "zod";

// Create an MCP server
const server = new McpServer({{
  name: "Demo",
  version: "1.0.0",
}});

// Add an addition tool
server.tool("add", {{ a: z.number(), b: z.number() }}, async ({{ a, b }}) => ({{
  content: [{{ type: "text", text: String(a + b) }}],
}}));

// Add a dynamic greeting resource
server.resource(
  "greeting",
  new ResourceTemplate("greeting://{{name}}", {{ list: undefined }}),
  async (uri, {{ name }}) => ({{
    contents: [
      {{
        uri: uri.href,
        text: `Hello, ${{name}}!`,
      }},
    ],
  }})
);

// Start receiving messages on stdin and sending messages on stdout
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

#### `.gitignore`

A file that lists the files to ignore in the project. `dist` should be ignored since it is the output directory.

## Steps To Complete

- Create the `package.json` file with the recommended scripts and dependencies.
- Use a `pnpm add` command to install the dependencies so that they are pinned to the current version. Do NOT use `latest` or `next`.
- Install the dependencies.
- Create the `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended configuration.
- Create the other files described above.
- Run `pnpm build` to build the project.
